In high school, one of my first larger coding projects was a simple graphing calculator that I wrote 
in Java using Swing.

<!--- <a href="" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/graphing-calculator.PNG" /></a> --->

It supported 
the five 
standard 
arithmetic operations $(+,-,\cdot,/,\hat{})$, as well as the following special functions:
$ \sin, \cos, \tan, \arcsin, \arccos, \arctan, \ln, \log, \sqrt{x}, | x |, \lfloor x \rfloor, \lceil x 
\rceil, \Gamma(x),$ and $ e^x $
(where $\Gamma(x)$ is the gamma function, defined by $\Gamma(x) = \int_{0}^{\infty} 
t^{x-1}e^{-t}dt$.)

In addition, it supported graphing the derivative of an inputted function. 

Besides graphing, it also had the capability of computing infix or postfix expressions involving the 
above operations and functions.

Here are a few sample graphs.

This is the graph of $\sin(x^2)\cdot \cos(x^3)$:
