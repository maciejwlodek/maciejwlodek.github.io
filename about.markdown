This is the personal webpage for Maciej Wlodek. I graduated from Longwood High School in the 
class of '17. Currently, I am studying Mathematics and Computer Science at Stony 
Brook University for my third year. I am a member of the SBU Math and Chess clubs, and occasionally, 
I attend meetings of the Go (Baduk) club. When I graduate, I plan to either 
continue my 
education by way of attending a graduate school for mathematics, or alternatively pursue a career as 
a 
software developer. 

# Work Experience

In the spring and summer of 2019, I had an internship at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, where I 
worked on several projects relating to the data processing and analysis of x-ray diffraction 
images of protein 
crystals at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II). I mostly worked with C, C++, 
Python, and R.

In the summer of 2018, I had an internship at the ABB Corporate Research Center in Cracow, 
Poland. There, I worked on developing a native implementation of the Bluetooth interface in the 
Java language for embedded Linux operating systems.

# Softwares

3. C
4. C++
5. Kotlin
6. MIPS assembly
7. R
8. Gradle

# Coursework

I have taken a plethora of courses, both in mathematics and computer science. In total, I have 
193 credits (counting the ongoing Fall '19 semester). In CS, I have taken a wide variety of 
topics covering both 
the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. These include Data Structure, 
Systems 
Fundamentals I 
and II, Analysis of Algorithms, and more. In mathematics, I have also taken 
courses 
in a wide variety of fields - including Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis, 
Differential 
Geometry, Topology, Enumerative Geometry, and more.
